TravelBug
============

I like to travel. Travelling without a destination in my mind is one of my favorite thing to do. One day I was wondering if there is an app where I can just put in the source airport and get all cheap flights from these airports to all available destinations. Then I thought, I can write a script for that. This is the product of that thought.

The script is not complete and is not annotated. This was just the result of a few hours of work. This script is written with selenium.
